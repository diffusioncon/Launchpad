# Submitting and judging procedure

## Submitting your results
You receive a designated public GitHub repository to submit your results, after you create your submission via [the Diffusion 2019 page on Devpost](https://diffusion2019.devpost.com).

It’s ok to work on a different repository during the hackathon, for example using a private GitHub repository, GitLab or local Git repositories. To submit your results however you must push them to your designated GitHub repository.

Make sure your code is pushed to your designated GitHub repository before Sunday 14:00. You can make some final changes until 15:00 as you prepare your presentation. Submissions with code committed after 15:00 will not be eligible for prizes.

## Judging procedure

### Summary

You'll receive a time slot of 30 minutes to present your project to judges at the judging tables. In these 30 minutes you can present multiple times. You can present to multiple tracks and multiple technologies. Judges will score your project, and after 17:00 the winners will be determined. The prize ceremony starts at 18:00.

### Procedure

Judging happens at judging tables on Floor 1 in the Library and Community Space. There are 14 tables, to account for the 10 tracks and additional technology prizes. An overview of all tables is provided below.

Judges will be sat at judging tables, tables are marked with a sign. You will need to go and find the right table to pitch.  Your team will receive a 30 minute time slot to pitch at the tables you want.

Your time slot will be communicated **via email**, at the email address with which you registered for Diffusion 2019 on Devpost.

You will have 5 minutes to present, with 2 minutes for Q&A, so 7 minutes in total. Within your 30 minute slot this gives time to present at 3 to 4 judging tables.

It’s up to you how many tables you want to visit, depending on the prizes you want to apply for. Some tracks and technologies will be more popular than others, so choose your tracks wisely to increase your chances of winning!

Example: you have built a project in the track A Stack for Good, using Fetch.ai, FOAM and Substrate. There are technology prizes for Fetch.ai and FOAM, but not for Substrate. You should pitch at the tables for A Stack for Good, Fetch.ai and FOAM.

## Judging tables and locations
Judging tables are marked with signs.

## FAQ

### What if I don't manage to present at all tables I want in my 30 minute slot?

Although we will do our utmost to divide the judging slots so that every team can present at every table they want, it might happen that some tables are very popular or that you are not able to present to all tables you want within your 30 minute slot. If this happens, contact Aron van Ammers or Theo Turner and we'll try to find a solution.

If you aim to present at many tables (3 or more), try to keep your presentation short so you can quickly go from table to table.

### Can I submit in multiple tracks?

Yes you can! For example, if your project is about permissioned data sharing, and uses machine learning, it would be great to present to both the _Machine Learning in the Decentralised World_ and _Sharing in Consortia Networks_ judging tables!
