This repository hosts code for quickly getting started with the protocols at the Diffusion Developer Conference 2019.

To get started, see the glossary of what to build on below.

## Thanks all for a massive Diffusion 2019! See you in 2020!

Check out the fantastic submissions under [DiffusionCon](https://github.com/DiffusionCon/Launchpad). Thanks to the hackers, mentors, judges, speakers and investors! See you at Diffusion 2020!

## Get started

### Get your repo

Submissions are made using your team's repo under the DiffusionCon organisation (this one). In order to get a repo, just register your submission on devpost [here](https://diffusion2019.devpost.com/) and **make sure at least one team member has their GitHub profile linked.** Your team repo will then be created for you, and you will have full access.

You can choose to work in a repo elsewhere (e.g. under your own GitHub user) provided you pull the latest version into your team's repo for judging. **Make sure whatever code you have is committed to your official repo by 14:00 on Sunday. You may continue editing until the deadline, as long as some of your code is in by 14:00.**

Check out the [tracks](https://github.com/DiffusionCon/Launchpad/blob/master/TRACKS.md) and the technology starter kits in this repo.

Submissions must use one of the technologies of the Convergence Stack, please see the [rules](https://diffusion2019.devpost.com/rules).

### Judging criteria

Diffusion is all about the diffusion of innovation - to bring the innovation of all protocols participating in Diffusion 2019 to a wider audience. Within this, there are two main areas judges will consider:

- User experience (UX) - for projects that build a product that will be used directly by people, e.g. a DApp or a service.
- Developer experience (DX) - for projects that build an API, tool or component that enable developers to work with the technologies out of the Convergence Stack.

Other aspects like technical soundness, security, and innovation are important, but within the above areas.

Furthermore, judges will consider the following aspects:

- Track fit: Judges are connected to tracks and will consider the fit of the project with the theme of the track, and any specific rules that track might have. See the details for your track in the track descriptions on the website and GitHub, and don’t be afraid to ask your track mentors in the track Telegram channel.
- Sustaining development: it’s important that you clarify how your project will continue to be developed. That might be a commercial model, and it might be something else like an open source community. You should have an answer to the question how your project could be alive in 1, 2, 12… months.
- Convergence Stack Mashup: judges will rate projects to use more than one technology out of the Convergence Stack in a sensible way more highly than projects that build on a single technology. There are 7 technologies handing out prizes to projects building on their technologies, so using multiple technologies is also a great way to qualify for more prizes.

With the exception of the token engineering track, **your submission must build on one or more of the protocols in the glossary above to be eligible for a prize.**
